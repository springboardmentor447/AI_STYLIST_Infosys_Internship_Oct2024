# Fashion Products Data Analysis

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a fashion products dataset.

## What We Do

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Convert LDJSON data to CSV.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., parsing JSON-like strings).

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Analyze distributions of `sales_price` and `rating`.
   - Generate correlation heatmaps and other visualizations.
   - Perform aggregation like average sales price by brand and ratings by delivery type.

## File

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` to process the data and generate visualizations.

```bash
jupyter notebook data_analysis.ipynb
```

This version is much more concise, easy to understand, and focused on the core actions of your project.
